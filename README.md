# US State Department Diplomatic Exchange Dataset
This repository contains data offered by the US Department of State on transfer of diplomats.

The dataset tracks all US diplomat exchanges since the late 1800sâ€”over a century and a half of data.

The Department of State wishes for MasonHacks participants to build creative data visialization tools for this dataset. Competitors who build innovative representative solutions will be featured on [diplomacy.state.gov](https://diplomacy.state.gov/) and/or at the National Museum of American History. Such participants will also be provided with opportunities for tech-sector governmental internships.
